### Video editing

- Transcribe and translation: audio to text, and multi-language translate
- Scene segmentation: based on text description or on video image understanding; 
- capturing highlight moments: based on text descriptions or video image understanding, including more complex moments, such as capturing a goal in soccer or a moment of a criminal attack. 
- Capturing moments based on specific phrases, such as extracting scenes where characters mention the phrase "by the way" during dialogue in a video. 
- Processing of video content (such as embedding subtitles, audio, or new commentary into an existing video, and stitching or blending video segments). 
- Developing a workflow platform where these elements are available as components, enabling drag-and-drop functionality for application development.



### Insight extraction

- Use web crawlers to gather data, process it, and convert it into text files in markdown format. 

- Vectorize these text files and store them in a vector database. 

- Process this information further to form a genuine knowledge base. 

- Generate insights from the knowledge base in response to specific questions.
