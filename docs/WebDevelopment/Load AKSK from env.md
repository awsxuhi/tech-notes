You should never include your AWS access key and secret access key in your front-end code. Instead, you should use environment variables to store sensitive information like your AWS credentials.

To load your AWS access key and secret access key from environment variables in your Node.js app, you can follow these steps:

1. Set your AWS access key and secret access key in your environment variables. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

```shell

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
```

1. Install the `dotenv` package to load the environment variables from the `.env` file. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```
bashCopy code
npm install dotenv
```

or

```
bashCopy code
yarn add dotenv
```

1. At the beginning of your Node.js script, add the following line to load the environment variables from the `.env` file:

```
javascriptCopy code
require('dotenv').config();
```

1. Now you can access your AWS access key and secret access key using `process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, respectively:

```
javascriptCopy code
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: 'your_region',
});
```

Keep in mind that storing your AWS credentials in the front-end code is insecure, and you should avoid it. Instead, use a backend service to handle AWS-related operations or use Amazon Cognito for client-side AWS access.

**Important:** Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being included in your version control system. This way, you won't accidentally expose your credentials.
